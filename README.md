This is my final project for WDI12. This is a project of love that will continue to evolve. I created an app for people to post tips on suspicious activity so they and others in the community could be more aware of their surroundings



I created an API for this project. The back end was constucted using Rails and the frontend was created using React


To view this project go to https://new-crime.herokuapp.com/ To run the app, clone from the repo and then run npm install and npm install material-ui

Huge shoutout to All of the WDI12 instructors for the support
